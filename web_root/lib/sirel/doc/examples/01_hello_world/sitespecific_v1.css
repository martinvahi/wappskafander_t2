/* A reminder: JavaScript files and CSS files get cached, which means
that one has to update their names every time one uptates web software.
One way to implement the renaming is to incude a file version into the
name of the file. That explains, why this file is renamed "sitespecific_v1.css"
in stead of just "sitespecific.css".*/
