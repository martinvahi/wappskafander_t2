// (For a different approach, please see: http://htmlpurifier.org .
//  As of 07.2009 some XSS examples might be found
//  from http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html )
//
// If the script is stored, let's say, into a database,
// in some unfiltered or reversible manner, then it is
// possible to filter it according to the software that will receive/display
// the script. In the case of the SQL injection one should try to
// use  parametrized data entry whenever possible.
