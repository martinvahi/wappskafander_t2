==============  wappskafander_t2 Development Documentation  ===============
===========================================================================

It's so small project that this COMMENTS.txt really captures the whole
developer targeted documentation.

The point of entry to all scripts, etc., is

    <project_root>/bin/start_or_restart_server.bash

, which calls the

    <project_root>/bonnet/wappskafander_t2_core/script_components/engine.rb

multiple times with different console arguments. The 
engine.rb reads in the 

    <project_root>/etc/wappskafander_t2_configuration.bash

, studies the system a bit and returns some values to 
stdout (i.e. the console) or generates some files.

                       Alternative Components
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current wappskafander_t2 is buit by using the 

    http://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/

as its core web server. The choice is a bit random and 

    http://cherokee-project.com/

might be used instead. 

The reason, why the Hiawatha won is that
the wappskafander_t2 is meant to be a pretty maintanence free
project and security is a component of reliability, 
which contributes to the decrase of maintanence.
