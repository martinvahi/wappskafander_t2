================  Kibuvits Ruby Library (KRL) Selftests  ==================
===========================================================================

All of the KRL testcase classes have a static method named "selftest".
The selftests are, by their nature, usually almost as thorough
demo code as it can get. The KRL code is aimed to be self-explanatory.

The ./ marks the folder that contains the COMMENTS.txt that 
You are currently reading.

To run all of the "selftest" methods within the KRL, one should
execute the 

ruby -Ku ../run_all_kibuvits_selftests.rb 

without giving it any console arguments. 
The test class names can be listed by executing:

    cd ../; ruby -Ku ./run_all_kibuvits_selftests.rb -l

To run the selftest of a single class
without running all of the KRL selftests, one should give the
name of the class as the first console argument. An example:

    ruby -Ku ./../run_all_kibuvits_selftests.rb Kibuvits_str_selftests

Usually a selftest class name starts with the name of the 
class that it tests and has a suffix of "_selftests". For example,
a selftest class of class The_most_awesome_library_ever is called
The_most_awesome_library_ever_selftests .
