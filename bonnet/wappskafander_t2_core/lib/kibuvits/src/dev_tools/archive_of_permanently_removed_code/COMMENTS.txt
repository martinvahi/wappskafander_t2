=============  Archive of Permanently Removed Legacy code  ================
===========================================================================

This folder contains code that was in use and probably even complete, but
that has become hopelessly deprecated.

It's stored here to allow some copy-pasting in case it turns out that
it was a mistake to refactor that code out.

One might argue that all code remains available in code repositories,
but the existence of this folder is justified by the fact that
it might be difficult to find the latest revision that contained
the code.

The selftests of the legacy code are not run and are not expected to pass.
